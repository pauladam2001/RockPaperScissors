---
# Used Concepts
- Object Oriented Programming
- Tkinter Graphical User Interface
- Pygame
- OpenCV (for capturing user's move through webcam)
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- SqueezeNet
- NumPy
---
# Functionalities
- The game can be played with the GUI (pressing buttons) or with the webcam, by showing a sign (rock, paper or scissors).
---
# Rules
- For Tkinter GUI just press one of the three butttons and the computer will make a random move.
