# RockPaperScissors
### Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Tkinter and AI (Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Network - SqueezeNet) for recognising the user's move.
---
# Used Concepts
- Object Oriented Programming
- Tkinter Graphical User Interface
- Pygame (sounds when you win/lose)
- OpenCV (for capturing user's move through webcam)
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- SqueezeNet
- NumPy
---
# Functionalities
- The game can be played with the GUI (pressing buttons) or with the webcam, by showing a sign (rock, paper or scissors).
---
# Rules
- For Tkinter GUI just press one of the three butttons and the computer will make a random move.
- For AI place your hand in the rectangle and make a sign. After the computer will recognize it, it will make a random move.

- AI (first I needed to collect sign images with collect_images.py, after that I had to train the computer with train.py)
